# HotelIndustry_Analytics_Project

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to perform in-depth data analysis on a hospitality dataset and visually communicate insights using Power BI. It involves building an interactive dashboard to present key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Revenue, Occupancy %, ADR, and RevPAR. The project simulates — gathering requirements, iterating on mockups and refining the dashboard to support data-driven decision-making in the hotel industry.

## 🚀 Workflow Summary
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**
    - Import and clean datasets (bookings, hotels, rooms, dates) using Power Query; model them using a star schema.

2. **KPI Definition & DAX Measures**
    - Define and create key metrics (e.g., RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %) using DAX formulas and calculated columns.

3. **Dashboard Design & Development**
    - Build an interactive Power BI dashboard with KPI cards, trends, slicers, and visual breakdowns (e.g., by city, channel, room type).

4. **Finalization & Documentation**
    - Finalize the dashboard, polish visuals, and document the entire process for portfolio or presentation.
